Getting started
===============
doxphinx is a theme for the Sphinx documentation system. The purpose of doxphinx
is to provide a single mechanism to generate the documentation of a project,
both in HTML and PDF formats, from a common source.

This common source of documentation consists of a set of text files written in
reStructuredText markup language along with a set of conventions for writing and
organizing the different files. The Sphinx tool can then be used to automatically
generate a HTML website or a PDF book, both from the same single documentation source.

How to use
==========
In order to use doxphinx, once installed, to document any project you just need
create a directory for the documentation files. Using the Sphinx tool, initialize
the directory as a Sphinx project and configure the conf.py file that will be
created, and you are ready to build the documentation using doxphinx.

At this point you can focus on the actual documentation work for your project.
Whenever the documentation is ready to be published or updated, use Sphinx to format
again the HTML website or the PDF book from the documentation source files.

Status
======
The doxphinx project is in DEVELOPMENT status. The internal structure of the theme
and extensions and the way of distributing releases may still change.
